These are the notes on how the separate pieces are supposed to be deployed.

The Donations.sol and Token.sol go hand in hand so you need to deploy the Token then the Donations platform then link the token to the platform and hand over ownership from the token to the platform. The Donation platform also uses Ownable.sol and Pausable.sol so they are required.

The auditing work is more extensive.
When you are deploying a contract that needs to be audited then that contracts requires the auditing contract. That is usually going to be done by others who want to be a part of our platform however initially when we are testing things then you can use your own contract.
We must first deploy the Audit NFT and the Datastore and then pass them in as arguments into the Auditing Platform and hand ownership of both to the platform so that only the platform can make the calls.
They also require Pausable / Ownable.

Keep in mind to check the dependencies as Ownable should be using Context from openzeppelin.
