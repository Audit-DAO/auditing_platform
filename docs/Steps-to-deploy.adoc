The ToDo.sol needs to be deployed with Auditable.sol

The Donations.sol needs to be deployed with Token.sol, self destruct the previous donations contract 
(make sure the website reflects the changes so that it does not cause issues for donators, you should
be able to do this by deploying the donations contract, getting its address and plugging it into the website
after which you put the site on ipfs - then destroy the previous donations contract but not the old NFT)

The Datastore.sol must be deployed first because you need its address for the auditing platform, same with the AuditNFT.sol
Once they are deployed you can deploy the platform and transfer ownership from the Datastore to the platform, and from the
AuditNFT to the platform.
