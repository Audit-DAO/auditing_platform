This is not meant for production as there is a lot of duplicated code pasted directly into each file to make imports not be a pain.
This is meant for QA testing as parts may not function as desired.

Here are the steps to use this in remix.

1) Deploy the data store
2) Deploy the Audit NFT
3) Deploy the Platform with the 2 parameters required (data store address, audit NFT address)
4) Transfer ownership to the platform in the data store and the audit NFT by going into the data store and the audit NFT respectively and using the transferOwnership
	function with the address of the platform
5) Deploy the ToDo with the 2 parameters required (auditor address, platform address) # note: I recommend that you use the default address selected out of the 10 that
	remix provides so that you do not have to think about which one you have added
6) To make the ToDo usable you must use the function setContractCreationHash with any address but remember which address you used because you need that same address to
	either approve or oppose the contract (approve to unlock functionality)
